## On smart cows and dumb politics

<!--excerpt-start-->

In light of the recent terrorist attack in [Insert Location] you have probably heard calls from media
and politicians to ban end to end encryption and stop the terrorists from having a safe space to 
communicate. Such calls sound like a good idea to those who don't really understand the technology 
much like a suggestion to ban guns could come across as a reasonable step to take in order to prevent
attacks but to those who do understand the technology, such a call becomes as ridiculous as a call to 
ban cars. Lets look at why. 

<!--excerpt-end-->

### What is end to end encryption?

Ordinarily when you send a message on the internet for example an email or a request to view a webpage, 
that message is sent unencrypted (or in plaintext, to use the correct term). This means that anyone 
in between you and the recipient can read and modify that message. It is the physical world equivalent
of sending a postcard. As the internet has matured, this method of sending message has become a 
security risk, since a malicious person could intercept your messages (this is clearly not good if
you are sending your credit card details to make a purchase). So we have turned to encryption in 
order to secure the data between you and the recipient.

There are two forms of encrypted message which can confuse the conversation slightly. The first is 
where messages you send are encrypted on your device using a third parties encryption key and sent 
to a server, the third party then decrypts the message and stores it. When the recipient logs on 
the third party will encrypt it again and send it over to them. This solves much of the problem, but
still leaves the messages on the server vulnerable if someone working at the company wants to access 
them for their own ends (or leak them to the internet as happened with Ashley Madison), the company
itself suffers a security breach or a government asks them nicely to turn them over.

The second kind is where you encrypt the message on your device with the key belonging to the 
recipient, transmit it to the third parties system encrypted, where they will store it and transfer
it onto the recipient when they log on. This time, only the recipient has the key to decrypt the
message so it is not vulnerable whilst stored by the third party. This is the type of system that
most people mean when they talk about end to end encryption.

### So what is the problem with banning it?

Looking at the previous three paragraphs, you may be thinking to yourself, well I can accept a lower
level of security, (1st or 2nd option) if it means we can stop terrorists from using encrypted 
messages as well. Pragmatically, I could probably accept the second option as a reasonable compromise
/if/ it meant we could stop terrorist attacks. 

Banning encryption will not stop terrorist attacks. 

Even if we mandated that companies providing messaging services did not provide the second, end to 
end encrypted service and that they scanned all messages (on behalf of the government) for any 
indications of terrorist plots in the making there would still be attacks. 

The logic behind banning encryption will stop terrorists stems from the fact that building an encrypted
messaging service is a hard or expensive problem which will only be tackled by corporations which we 
can exert legal or financial pressure on to comply with our laws. Taking away the services provided 
by these companies will mean the terrorists will be caught. 

There is some weight behind that argument: writing an encrypted app does require programming skills 
which very few terrorists have. The incorrect conclusion drawn from this is that only terrorists 
with advanced programming skills will be able to communicate securely and the rest we'll catch from 
their unencrypted communications. This conclusion melts away entirely when you consider the smart cow
problem.

### Bovine terrorist sympathisers, have you gone mad?
 
No, please bear with me. Imagine, you are a farmer and that you keep a field of cows. The field is
surrounded by a fence, in order for you to be able to take the cows for milking once a day, there 
is also a gate in the fence with a latch. You would think that you are able to go to bed at night 
confident that your cows will all still be in the field in the morning and for a field of ordinary
cows you would be right. 

What if one cow was not ordinary? 

What if one cow was smarter than the average cow? 

What if one cow in your field knew how to undo the gate latch?

If you were unlucky enough to have just one smart cow in your field the whole heard could escape as 
once the first cow figures out how to open the gate the other ordinary cows simply have to walk out 
through the now open gate. You may still find in the morning that one or two exceptionally dumb cows
are still there as they hadn't even realised the gate was open but most will have escaped despite not
having the smarts to open the gate for themselves.

This is the smart cow problem, when faced with a difficult problem it is often only necessary for one
smart person to solve it and everyone else can benefit from their solution.

### Conclusion

The smart cow problem crops up all the time in technology a key example is that of DRM. AACS was broken
by one person wanting to watch a HDDVD on an unsupported device That solution was shared. Now everyone
is able to copy Bluray and HDDVD's at will. The same is true of encrypted messengers - it only takes
one smart terrorist to write an app and share it and we are in no better situation than we are now 
from an anti terrorism perspective but have sacrificed our own privacy for no reason.
