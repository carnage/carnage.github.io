## Paying for speaker expenses

<!--excerpt-start-->

This is a subject which comes up a lot. Should conferences be expected to pay for 
the expenses of their speakers? There are a lot of reasons that conferences give
for not doing so, in this post I will explore some of these reasons and present 
my perspective from both the speaking side and organisation side as to why they 
are not good enough. 

<!--excerpt-end-->

To answer the question posed: yes. Conferences should always* set aside a budget to
cover speaker expenses. *There are a few exceptions here such as unconferences which
don't have pre-selected speakers, but on the whole, this holds true. 

I'll illustrate this answer with the first reason conferences give for not covering
expenses.

### Do it for exposure

The first reason conferences often give is that speakers will benefit from exposure
of being on stage and get employment opportunities from it. This may work out well 
for some free lancers however once you take into account the expenses, the days of 
lost work and the time put in preparing the material it has got to be one of the 
least cost effective methods of promoting yourself. It also bothers me a lot as the
conferences that tend to fall back on this reason are for profit conferences, often
put on by big corporations.

I have been speaking for about four years and have yet to get a contract or offer
because of speaking. There have been a couple of instances where it has helped land
a contract found through other means (my favorite being someone recognising me in
an interview and discussing the talk instead of asking other questions) but "exposure"
hasn't helped me. 

The biggest issue I take with this line of reasoning however is how it totally 
ignores the fact that a conference cannot happen without it's speakers. A conference
especially a for profit one which expects speakers to, not just do work for free but
to actually bear out of pocket costs for it is really not acceptable.

### We're not paying ourselves/our helpers

This comes up a fair amount, conferences aren't paying expenses for the helpers who
help organise the event so, they don't have to pay speakers expenses either. To my
mind there are two things wrong with this position, firstly the amount of preparation
which goes into producing a talk is generally significantly higher than the work 
going into helping out on the registration desk in the morning etc. This could be
used as a justification for separate treatment - I have seen conferences which are 
effectively offering a free ticket to the event to people in return for an hour or
two of their time each day to help run it and advertise it as such.

There is another significant flaw to this line of reasoning; the obvious answer to
we are not paying for our helpers expenses is why not? Depending on the number of 
staff supplied by the venue, you can sometimes get away without many helpers but 
like the speakers the event can't happen without them, the least you can do is 
ensure they are not out of pocket. The bonus with helpers is that they usually 
live locally, which reduces any travel or accommodation costs they may have so
there is really no excuse for not covering them.

### Do it to give something back

This one really only works when used by a not for profit event; the idea that people
should volunteer their time and money to help out others is a nobel one, however it
is not without it's own significant downsides. From a speakers perspective, this is 
only something I'm willing to do on a limited basis, usually for local events such 
as user groups. I'm not going to pay to fly to another country, plus a hotel for 
several nights to speak at your conference - there are better causes for me to 
donate my money to.

My biggest objection to this reason however comes from a conference organiser 
perspective: the moment you start expecting people to cover their own costs you 
seriously limit the pool from which you can draw speakers. I and many of the regular
speakers you see at events can afford to cover our own costs or have employers who
are willing to cover them for us. You can have a selection of these regular speakers
for your event and you will have good content, but if you want truly great content,
you have to look beyond the regulars and bring in speakers from different backgrounds,
not all of whom are in the position to cover their own costs.  
  
### We can't afford it

I've saved this reason till last as it is probably the most common reason. A lot of
events, especially the not for profit ones, don't believe they can afford to pay for
speaker expenses (if you are a for profit conference using this reason, your conference
seriously lacks a viable business model). The general logic behind this is that they
want to keep the ticket prices low to make them "affordable", again a nobel aim but
see previous section.

Part of the reason this comes up is because the conference leaves thinking about 
paying expenses far too late in the planning stages. If you want to be able to afford
them you have to plan it in from the very beginning. For PHP Yorkshire, I maintain 
a spreadsheet containing worst case speaker costs eg a hotel, full conference ticket,
speaker dinner and full travel budget for every speaker slot. We budget £200 for each
speakers travel and this has covered all but one speaker slot (It was a double header
so twice the travel costs) so far. I also set aside enough to cover a long haul flight
as an additional expense.

Speaker expenses also factor into the selection process once we've narrowed down a
short list based on the talk content, we begin to factor in additional constraints
such as travel expenses, balancing the number of local speakers who's expenses will
be lower against those coming in from further away. Last year having a speaker do a 
workshop and a talk saved us a whole speaker's worth of expenses we were able to 
spend on other things. We also limit the event to two tracks, this cuts down the
total number of speakers but also forces us to make sure that each talk covers a 
distinct area - there is no room for talks which are too similar to each other.

All together, we had a budget of ~£500 per speaker although most didn't use it all
this would make speakers our largest expense if the entire budget was used up. 
Despite this, we still managed to keep the ticket prices down. A small number were 
sold for just £78 with the majority sold at £90-£96, a few last minute tickets were
sold for £108. Although it's not quite as cheap as some events, it still falls into
a very affordable bracket, even for developers who aren't lucky enough to have their
employers buy their ticket.

### Conclusion

Pay your speakers' costs.

As a speaker, I'm in the fortunate position that I can afford to pay my own way to
come to a conference but generally, I won't do this. I do make exceptions to this,
eg I will cover my own travel if it's within driving distance and I often pay to 
upgrade the offered speaker package eg a business class flight, extra hotel nights
or an extended stay, however I won't usually even submit to a conference which 
doesn't offer a full speaker package to cover the basics.

As an organiser, my original goal was not just to cover speakers expenses but to
pay them an appearance fee. So far, this hasn't been viable however this year we
will be bringing in a profit share model for our workshop speakers. If the 
conference continues to show strong growth in both attendee numbers and sponsorship
take up I hope that we will be able to extend this to speakers next year.

Personally, I am strongly against the idea of speakers having to pay to speak at 
an event. I often see event organisers pushing back against speakers who speak out
against pay to speak, saying that they don't understand the realities of running a
conference. I do. My hope is that, by adding my weight as an organiser to the 
argument, more conferences will seek to end pay to speak practices.

Finally, as a way of putting these beliefs into practice, PHP Yorkshire will be
sponsoring one of last years speakers, Heather Burns, to speak at Drupal con EU
next week. Her talk at PHP Yorkshire was excellent, so if you are at Drupal con
make sure you go to her talk, you won't be disappointed.
