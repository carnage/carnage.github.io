Much of the software we write is built to support a business process, this generally means validating and storing user data into a database. Often this is a mismatch with the actual business process, which is more reactive and task oriented. In this talk we'll look at using business events to drive the evolution of our software design and see how we can build a model which better reflects the businesses processes.
