## When is an employee, not an employee?

<!--excerpt-start-->

When a software system is mature enough, it has a tendency to attract classes which are 
pivital in their role, the center of the system, which gain large amounts of responsibility
either over crucial functions or over data. This post is a case study of one such occurrence
I have seen in the past, where by an employee entity became such a class. By using the domain
driven design concept of a bounded context; I'll show how the situation could have been 
rectified.
